# Mamba2 Features Status for macOS

This document tracks the implementation status of Mamba2 features on macOS Apple Silicon.

## Feature Status Table

| Feature | Description | Status | Notes |
|---------|-------------|---------|-------|
| Basic Mamba Block | Core Mamba SSM block implementation | Implemented | Working on both CPU and MPS |
| Selective Scan Operation | Core SSM operation for sequence modeling | Implemented | Using reference implementation on macOS |
| MPS (Metal) Acceleration | GPU acceleration using Apple's Metal | Implemented | Available when MPS is supported |
| Text Generation | Basic text generation capabilities | Implemented | Using simplified model without Triton |
| Model Sizes | Support for different model configurations | Implemented | Small (1M), Medium (8M), Large (32M) params |
| Mamba2 Architecture | Full Mamba2 model implementation | Implemented | Using macOS-compatible implementation without Triton |
| Variable Length Sequences | Support for variable length input sequences | Implemented | Basic support available |
| Training Support | Model training capabilities | Not Implemented | Currently focused on inference |
| Triton Optimizations | CUDA/Triton optimizations | Not Implemented | Not available on macOS |
| Complex Number Support | Support for complex number operations | Not Implemented | Limited to real numbers on macOS |
| Mixed Precision (FP16) | Support for half-precision operations | Not Implemented | Using FP32 for better compatibility |
| Batch Processing | Efficient batch processing | Implemented | Basic batch support available |
| RMSNorm | Root Mean Square Normalization | Implemented | Using reference implementation |
| Convolution Operations | Local convolution operations | Implemented | Basic implementation available |

## Notes

1. The implementation focuses on inference rather than training
2. Some features are simplified or use reference implementations due to macOS limitations
3. MPS acceleration is available but may not match CUDA performance
4. Complex number support and mixed precision are currently limited
5. The implementation prioritizes stability and compatibility over performance optimizations

## Next Steps

1. Implement training support
2. Add mixed precision support where possible
3. Optimize MPS performance
4. Add more comprehensive testing
5. Improve documentation and examples
