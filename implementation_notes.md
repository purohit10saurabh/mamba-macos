# Mamba2 Implementation Notes for macOS

This document details the implementation of Mamba2 for macOS, focusing on the adaptations and optimizations made for Apple Silicon compatibility.

## Overview

The Mamba2 implementation for macOS provides a full-featured version of the Mamba2 architecture that works without CUDA/Triton dependencies. The implementation prioritizes compatibility with Apple Silicon while maintaining the core functionality of the Mamba2 model.

## Architecture Implementation

### Core Components

1. **Mamba2MacOS Module** (`mamba_ssm/modules/mamba2_macos.py`)
   - Full implementation of the Mamba2 architecture
   - Compatible with both CPU and MPS (Metal Performance Shaders)
   - Key features:
     - Selective scan operation
     - Convolution layer
     - State space model parameters
     - Input/output projections
     - Layer normalization

2. **Model Structure**
   ```python
   class Mamba2MacOS(nn.Module):
       def __init__(
           self,
           d_model,          # Model dimension
           d_state=64,       # SSM state dimension
           d_conv=4,         # Convolution kernel size
           expand=2,         # Expansion factor
           headdim=128,      # Head dimension
           ngroups=1,        # Number of groups
           A_init_range=(1, 16),  # SSM parameter initialization
           dt_min=0.001,     # Minimum delta time
           dt_max=0.1,       # Maximum delta time
           ...
       )
   ```

### Key Adaptations for macOS

1. **Selective Scan Operation**
   - Implemented using PyTorch operations instead of CUDA kernels
   - Optimized for MPS acceleration
   - Supports variable length sequences
   - Maintains numerical stability

2. **Memory Management**
   - Efficient caching for inference
   - Optimized tensor operations for MPS
   - Careful handling of device placement

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Batch processing support
   - Efficient state management
   - MPS-specific optimizations where applicable
